## Background

The field of biology has witnessed significant advancements with the development of technologies such as Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR). CRISPR allows for precise editing of genetic material, offering potential applications in genome editing for the prevention and treatment of human diseases.

## Problems

Introducing CRISPR-edited individuals into a natural population poses challenges, such as potential mutations leading to resistance over time. The precision and specificity of CRISPR-mediated edits, off-target effects, unintended mutations, and ethical concerns are critical issues to address.

## Proposed Method/Algorithm

The simulation involves creating a population with CRISPR-edited females and introduces the concept of CRISPR resistance. Key tracked metrics include population growth, CRISPR female count, sterile male count, and CRISPR resistance female count. The simulation aims to address the complexities of introducing CRISPR into natural populations.

## Theories/Concepts

The CRISPR system, utilizing Cas-9 and guide RNA, is employed to edit DNA sequences. Natural selection and genetic dynamics play a crucial role in the algorithm, simulating the principles of evolution. The emergence of CRISPR resistance is a conceptual hypothesis, suggesting adaptive responses over time within populations.

## Measurement

Metrics, including population metrics, genetic diversity, and quantitative measures, are employed to evaluate the simulation's outcomes.

## How to Run the Simulation
First, we need to download all the files. You can type git clone https://github.com/raissaazaria/CompBioFP on your terminal.


After the file is downloaded, make sure to import necessary stuff before running the code.









Go to the config.py file and set the number as needed.





This is the sample of the result with the input number from the config.py file. If the user wants to change the graph, the user can close the previous displayed graph, and go to config.py to change the number. After the number being changed, the user can try to re-run the code from the run.py file and see the new displayed graph.

## Results

The simulation results indicate interactions between CRISPR individuals, resistance development, and population dynamics. Note: Currently, there may be inaccuracies in the results due to ongoing code refinement.

## Discussion/Analysis

The decline of CRISPR resistance females, coinciding with the mirroring of CRISPR females and sterile males, prompts inquiries about the lasting impact of the introduced genetic changes. Further investigation is needed to understand factors influencing population stability, genetic diversity, and long-term effects.

## Feedback/Revision

-	Fixed data
	We tried to find fixed data, but since the simulation runs on the user's needs it is hard to pinpoint a particular fixed data.
-	Research algorithm name and flow
	We tried to find a particular name for the algorithm name but we could not find it.
-	Consider different measurements
	We tried to add different measurements, but we cannot seem to find one that fits into the simulation.
-	Deploy UI
	We tried to deploy the UI, but we cannot seem to make it work. The UI part of the code won't be able to connect to the rest of the code, so we decided to not deploy it.

## Conclusion and Recommendation

The project underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of the interplay between CRISPR interventions and natural populations. Recommendations include refining the simulation, improving accuracy, and conducting comprehensive analyses for meaningful insights.
